# Next steps
## Development
0. Install locally
1. Set up as command in $PATH

3. Re-sync outdated files: test
4. Discover played _pruned tracks: read RB XML to determine played tracks in archive playlists
5. Check if existing playlist has any previously played tracks
6. Read Rekordbox DB for unassigned Tags in _pruned
7. Use GitHub for project management
